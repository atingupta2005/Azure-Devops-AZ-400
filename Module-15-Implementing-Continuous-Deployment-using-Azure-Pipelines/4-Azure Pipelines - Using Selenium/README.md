# Run Selenium test cases from Azure Pipelines

1. Import Github Project to Azure repo
  - https://github.com/atingupta2005/azure-devops-seleniumtest
1. Create Build Pipeline named - seleniumtest
1. Replace the code with - [pipeline.txt](pipeline.txt)
1. Create release pipeline
1. Start with Empty job
1. Add stage name - UI testing
1. Pipeline name - selenium testing
1. Add artifact from build pipeline
1. Add task to UI Testing Job and change agent specification to use Windows 2019
1. Add task - Visual Studio test Platform Installer
1. Add another task - Visual Studio Test
1. Configure task Visual Studio Test
    - Specify test file - **\seleniumtest.dll and remove everything else
    - Specify Search folder - <>\_seleniumtest\drop
      - Note: Here the path _seleniumtest\drop depends on the name of the build pipeline and the artifact directory name generated by build Pipeline. To know the exact name of the directory, refer to Artifacts stage of the release pipeline.

1. Enable trigger - Continuous Integration
1. Save and release pipeline
1. Now simulate a failure by changing the test case in UnitTest.cs
