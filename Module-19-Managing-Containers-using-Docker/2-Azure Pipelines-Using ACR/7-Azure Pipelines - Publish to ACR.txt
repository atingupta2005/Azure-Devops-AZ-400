We need to build Docker image using pipeline
Then deploy that docker image to ACR using pipeline
We need to build multistage Dockerfile so that the DotNet code can be built first from the source code

1. For the Dockerfile, put the content (from ACR_Dockerfile.txt) in a file - Dockerfile
2. Place Dockerfile as part of your code or upload it to your Azure Repos - Git repository
3. Create a new Azure Repo - docker-repo
4. Create a new ASP.Net Core Web App and place Docker file in root folder
5. Change Index page - Welcome to Azure Pipelines - Docker
6. Push code from VSCode to Azure Repo
7. Open ACR and remove Repositories from it if any
8. Also stop the ACI if any in Azure Portal
9. Create a new build pipeline
10. Chose task - Docker (Build and Push an image to ACR), Image name: dotnetapp
11. In pipeline code change the tag to latest
12. Save and Run
13. Visit ACR\Repositories and refresh to view the newly pushed docker image
14. Open ACI and start it. It will now take the latest image
15. Grab public ip of ACI and open in browser
